## 🚀 Deployment

Clone repository:

```sh
git clone https://codeberg.org/thirtysix/painterest.git && cd painterest
```

### 🐳 With Docker

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### 💻 Without containerization

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.lock
uvicorn src.main:app --no-access-log --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips '*' --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8889
```

### 🛡️ Running behind a reverse proxy

To run the app behind a reverse proxy, ensure that the appropriate proxy headers are added.
Below is a sample configuration for NGINX:

```text
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8889;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

For Caddy (binary installation), here is a sample `Caddyfile` configuration:
```text
https://domain.tld {
        reverse_proxy localhost:8889
}
```
